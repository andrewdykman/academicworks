Some of the academic works by Andrew J. Dykman, A.A.S., S.D.T. completed while attending ITT Technical Institute. This repository was created to allow potential employers to view my coding in order to gauge my competency in working with certain sotware langauges and other related aspects of the software development field. (The works listed here were completed between June 2011-2013 before graduation).
